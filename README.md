# Single Save

Modern life has no save files.  
There are no reloads. No retries. No alternate timelines.

You get one run.

Single Save is a minimal system built around one rule:

> Zero days do not exist.

Each day must record at least one intentional action.

Not a maximum.  
A minimum.

Not productivity optimization.  
Continuity.

You are free to build, expand, overperform.

The system only eliminates zero.

## Core Idea

Every day is a new save point.

You cannot reload yesterday.  
You can write today.

## Design Principles

- Minimal
- Friction-aware

There is no reload.

Write today.
